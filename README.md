# consistent_trees
A Go package for reading output generated by Peter Behroozi's consistent-trees code.

This code is in a very preliminary state. The most important getters and all the exported funcitons are safe to use, although I haven't tested every single getter for typos. I think I might be the only person in the world who uses Go for this type of project, so it's a little hard for me to find the motivation to test the parts I don't use :(.
